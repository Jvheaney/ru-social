# RU Social

The date is January 14, 2020. You've come up with a funny idea to make a dating app for your university (at the time, Ryerson University) while working out. It will be called RU Mine. You message your friends, tell them your idea, and a close friend of yours agrees to make it with you. You tell him, "If the domain is available, I will build it".


It was available.


Thus started the journey to make Ryerson's dating app, which permanently shifted the culture of the school and lead to the development of a social network that impacted thousands of Ryerson students. A story that involves fierce competition, crashing servers, DDoS attacks, sleepless nights, hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and countless stories of love and cheating. This is the story of RU Mine, Ryerson University's dating app turned social media icon.
